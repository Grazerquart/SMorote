# Search Engines
Just a list of search engines other than google, generally geared towards a specific purpose.

## Scientific Papers
#### [Bioline](https://bioline.org.br)
Bioline has a number of partnered journals available to search, mostly geared towards biology.
#### [RefSeek](https://refseek.com)
RefSeek is just a search engine focused on crawling sources that hold scientific papers.
#### [Science.gov](https://science.gov)
US Government run website for searching through papers released by government agencies.
## Image Searching
#### [Google Lens](https://www.google.com/imghp)
Reverse image search usually won't be particularly helpful for finding an original source, but helps find alternate versions. Great place to start.
#### [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com/)
If you have an original image from art or an anime screenshot this might be the best shot.
#### [trace.moe](https://trace.moe/)
Dedicated just to finding an anime from a screenshot.
#### [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)
Works well if you have the original image, and has logs of time and date found for each result.
#### [Yandex Images](https://yandex.com/images/)
Similar to Google Lens in many ways, shows pages with fairly similar results to the image given.

## Miscellaneous Searches
#### [Shodan](shodan.io)
Shodan is great for finding servers that host a specific type of service. Allowing you to filter by anything from ports to versions of a service.
#### [QPublic](https://qpublic.schneidercorp.com)
Incredibly helpful tool, makes it easy to check addresses against tax records. Privately run so there is delay, but generally accurate.
#### [USPS Zip Code Lookup Tool](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm)
Great for validating any US address.

#### [Whats My Name](https://whatsmyname.app/)
Runs through sites looking for other places where the same username is used.
